# MalwareDatabase
####Banco de dados de malware

####Isenção de responsabilidade

Este repositório é uma das poucas coleções de malware no GitHub. Quase todas as amostras aqui são maliciosas, então eu recomendo fortemente que você não abra esses arquivos em hardware real, nem use mal o malware para pregar peças em seus amigos. Jogar com essas amostras pode levar a consequências irreversíveis que podem afetar desde dados pessoais até senhas e informações bancárias.


### Introduction
Most of people say: "**Malware isn't a toy to play with!**", however, I don't hold such an opinion. Malware is fun, if you know how to play with it! :wink: In my opinion, people who think opposite are gloomy and tedious or just afraid of it. Nonetheless, I still **DO NOT** recommend you using malware for your personal needs and benefits. **If you want to ask any type of questions (e. g. Archive password doesn't match; Provided malware doesn't work! etc.) use the "*Issues*" tab.** Also here are the steps if you want to support me and my repository!
